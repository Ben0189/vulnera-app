# Vulnerability Demonstration Application

## Overview
This application is designed to demonstrate software vulnerabilities for the UTS software penetration testing course. The tool is aimed at helping lecturers showcase different types of vulnerabilities and their potential impacts, making the learning experience more interactive and practical.

## How To Setup 
Here are the step by step guide to setup the application locally - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1nC8W77j84

## Features
Lecturer Demonstrations: Currently supports demonstrations of several common vulnerabilities (XXS, SQL injection).

## Vulnerabilities
The application currently covers or plans to cover the following vulnerabilities:

- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

## Future Development
Additional Vulnerabilities: Adding more types of vulnerabilities for comprehensive coverage.
Interactive Features: Allowing students to interact with the application for hands-on learning.
Enhanced User Interface: Improving the UI for better usability and engagement.

## Motivation
This project aims to enhance the educational experience for students in the software penetration testing course at UTS. By making the course content more interactive and practical, we hope to better prepare students for real-world scenarios.
